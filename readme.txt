EQ Analyzer - v0.0.1

All code created and maintained by Jamie Leibowitz

This program is intended to help music producers like myself to be able to compare their own tracks to professionally produced tracks, allowing them to adjust their mixing and mastering to more closely resemble their "reference tracks". 

To use this program, first run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to ensure you have the correct modules for this program to function. On opening, you will be asked to select a file, and then another file, currently restricted to .wav and .mp3 files. As I figure out more functions I hope to update this program to be able to open more types of sound files.
